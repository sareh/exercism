# exercism

This is a repo for my exercism exercises. Please see http://exercism.io/ for details.

Exercism is a site where you can 

- download and solve practice problems in nearly 30 different programming languages,

- submit the solution to the site for feedback (beta), and

- it's for code newbies as well as experienced programmers! (It starts with a Hello World and gets harder along the way.)

I really enjoy it, since it has short exercises and makes me work in a TDD way. It also makes me think about what extra tests I can create to add more hurdles to exercises. 

Give it a try - it's pretty addictive. :)
